# PurgeCSS issue with dynamic class names in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using PurgeCSS with Tailwind CSS and dynamic class names generated by a JavaScript framework.

## Problem

PurgeCSS fails to remove unused styles when class names are dynamically generated, leading to increased bundle size. This can happen if the framework is not properly configured to allow PurgeCSS to identify and process dynamic classes.

## Solution

The solution involves properly configuring PurgeCSS to work with the JavaScript framework used. This typically involves specifying the correct patterns or functions for detecting dynamic classes.
